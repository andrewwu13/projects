# My Smaller Personal Projects
These are a combination of some projects that I don't feel like deserve their own repository, so I combined them all into one larger folder. Most files were created for high school assignments, and while I cannot share my actual assignments on Github, I am able to share the respective code I used. 

## Projects

  - How does variation in the bonding element to a carbonate affect the rate of temperature change and volume of gas produced when reacting with sulfuric acid?
- Physics IA
  - The investigation of the relationship between the initial release height and the beat frequency in a Wilberforce Pendulum
